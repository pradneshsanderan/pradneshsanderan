**`Aspiring Software engineer/developer`**

I'm a MSc Computer Science student expanding my knowledge and improving myself, one project at a time. All coding projects are either projects from school or my own personal projects and are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Pradnesh's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student at the University of Edinburgh, knowing nothing about computer science aside from the fact that I liked coding (I had very little experience coding in Python) and loved solving problems. I had a passion for everything there was to learn about programming, which led me to teach myself how to code, build apps and websites, and explore complex topics like machine learning and category theory (Undergraduate Thesis Project). From the first lecture, I always knew that I wasn‚Äôt the smartest or most skilled person in the room, but I always tried my best to be. This led to long hours in the library every day and lots of hard work. This was all worth it when I graduated in the summer of 2023 with honours. Currently, I am pursuing my master's in computer science at the University of Edinburgh, continuing to grow my knowledge and skills. Although I have achieved some things and gained some knowledge, I never stopped learning and never will. As much as it is tedious and tiring to learn about a new concept or framework, I will always see this as a hobby and passion of mine, which only drives me further.
